#  SEARCH ENGINE PROTOTYPE

## Project Discription:
In this Project I have Attempted to Create a Prototype of a Search Engine. I Used Python along with many libraries to Create my Search Engine.
Other Feature That I hope to Include are:
1. Frontend Site to Display all the data using React
2. An Online Database to store all the data using Mongodb

## For In-depth Working Details Refer : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1buCU3UkHNPgrtKWsf_GljoihsuMAorURldudqSxxQeg/edit?usp=sharing
## How to Install:
### 1. Fork this Repository and Search Pages Repository(https://github.com/XmatrixZ/SearchingPages)
### 2. Clone your forked repositorys to your pc ( git clone "url from clone option").
### 3. Run your git bash and type "git clone repo-url" where repo-url is the url that you get from clone option which is "https://github.com/XmatrixZ/SearchEngine.git"
### 4. Now once you have cloned both repository to your pc you can start using it.

# Happy Coding!!

## How to Use Project: 
### 1. First Run the Current Search Engine Project which is used to create the dataset for searching.
### 2. Be Pacient as it takes time to create the dataset.
### 3. Once the dataset is created it will create a txt file.
### 4. Then Run the Search Bar python code and make sure you are able to extract dataset from the text file by adding the correct location.
### 5. Now You will be able to search words that will show on which all sites its found and shows it in order as you would when u search a word in google
